# Classes

## Problem Statement

Define a class FamilyMember that has at least 5 properties (e.g., name, sex, status,	age, children) and then	create 5 instances of that class, each of which should be assigned to the following	variables: fm1, fm2, fm3, fm4, fm5.	Define two methods â€“ parent? and child?	that will test whether an instance of this class is	a parent or	a child	and	what type of parent	or child (father, mother, son, daughter, dog). The method should make use of the properties of the objects.

Create an array of these family members and search through it using "each" and print out their names , and status (married, single, underage)

Create and array of these family members and search through it using "do", to print out all of the information known about them. (i.e. all their attributes)
