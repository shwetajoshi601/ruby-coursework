This repository is for all my solutions to the practical assignments from the course - Exploring Ruby at UCD (COMP47530)

## Getting Started

1. Install Ruby

    You can download the installer from the [Official Website](https://rubyinstaller.org/).

2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. Verify if Ruby was successfully installed. Open terminal, type the command:

    ruby -v

    This must display the version of Ruby installed.
4. You can start writing code in your favorite editor and save the files with the **.rb extension**.
Alternatively, you can use **Interactive Ruby (IRB)**. Search for **irb** and open the window to begin.

Happy Learning!! :)
